D_tot_Week_6 is the defence totals up to and including week 6 (i.e. Week 7 games upcoming)

Games Played column added manually (when data scraped? After TNF (e.g. cardinals seahawks between 9 and 10)? COVID games delayed etc.). Ballache but necessary

Arthur did the first Defence Summary (week 6) in the middle of NFL Sunday! Binned it and started from week 7


I believe I am training on data that are using for testing/labels. Needs more consideration.
Also week 7 is very similar to week 8 data (e.g. mean wont change much)
